# Election-Analysis
## Overview of Election Audit: 
### Purpose:
This election audit is being performed as a means of figuring out if the vote counting process can be automated using Python. Even in small elections there are typically a large number of votes cast by voters. These votes may come in the form of mail in ballots, punch cards, and direct recorded electronic votes. Due to the various methods being used by voters the process of counting these votes can be cumbersome. For this reason there is a need to automate the process so that the votes and winner can be certified quicker. Completing the audit could be ground breaking for future elections where archaic methods of counting votes are still being used.

## Election-Audit Summary:
This audit of the votes cast in Jefferson, Denver, and Arapaphoe County reveals the power of Python. Although there were 369,711 votes counted the process was automated utilizing the Python language. As long as there is a CSV file to read, python coding can produce the same results for future elections. What was learned through this election is that by changing the variables and commands within the script the results of various elements can be captured. This same script would work for other elections as long as there is a properly captured CSV file and variables put in place. It is my recommendation that this idea be explored for an upcoming local election so that the theory can be proven.
